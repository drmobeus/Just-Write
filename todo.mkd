# TODO

- Change .live( 'click', function() { ... } ); to .delegate() or w/e ( faster )
- Consistent shortcuts
- Sort out character encoding - it's broken
- Redo salts ( every user should have a unique random salt in the DB )
- Save current document when user logs out.
- Hide main menu + logout button when the mouse has stopped moving/the title input isn’t in focus.
- Sharing/publishing to URL?
